Pre-season Team Entry and Challenge Round
-----------------------------------------

Teams ranked 1 to 14 are in the league without challenge. All other
teams are placed into the challenge round to determine four additional
teams.


19 or 20 teams: one pool, top four are in
21 to 26 teams. two pools, top two from each pool are in.
27 or more teams: four pools, top one from each pool is in.


For each pool, the highest ranked team is the pool captain. 

In the case of un-even pool sizes, additional teams Bye1, Bye2, etc,
are added to make the number of teams evenly divisible by the number
of pools.

The pool captains take turns picking teams to join their pool in
round-robin fashion until all teams are formed into a pool.

The final pool rankings will be determined as follows:

* record (most wins)
* head-to-head (this rule is only applied once. For example , if three
  teams are tied in record, and their head-to-heads are 1-1, 1-1, and
  0-2, the two teams tied are 1-1 "continue" and are evaluated by the
  next item, not by head-to-head again)
* ends won
* points scored
* team shootout


Examples: 19 teams

C1 C2 pick from C3, C4, and C5, and Bye

C1: bye
C2: C3
C3:
Mid-season Challenge Rounds
---------------------------

Mid-season challenge rounds are eliminated. 


Fifths
------

* all players (fifths, alternates, regulars) who played in 3 or more
  games are eligible for points

* each team is alloted 400 percent of the team ranking point value to
  be split among its players by mutual agreement, or if no agreement,
  by skip's vote. Each eligible player can be assigned a fraction from
  0.0 to 1.0 of the team ranking point value, as long as the sum of
  the points allocated adds up to 4 times the base team ranking point
  value. Example: A team with 5 members places 11th and earns 19.5
  points per player. The following are valid assignments:

  example one: 1 100%, 2 80%, 3 80%, 4 60%, 5 80%
  example two: 1 80%, 2 80%, 3 80%, 4 80%, 5 80%
  example three: 1 100%, 2 100%, 3 100%, 4 50%, 5 50%

  In example three, player 5 would earn 50% * 19.5 = 9.75 points.
  

Team Ranking 
------------

At the start of the season, teams are ranked by summing player points.

The "team ranking point total" will be calculated by adding the four
player totals if four players are registered on the team, or the
highest four player totals if five players are registered on the team.
