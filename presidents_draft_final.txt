Dear President's Leaguers:

Thanks once again for your feedback on proposed re-structuring of the brackets and league entry system. 

Here is my final proposal for re-structuring the league, pending possible input from the board and more constructive criticism from interested parties.

Summary of league format rules:
 - top 14 teams are in league for entire season
 - up to 28 teams for 7 weeks; 3 game guarantee for teams 15 and below
 - all games are on Tuesday; no "extra" challenge round games
 - league size drops from 21+ to 20 to 18 to 16 
 - A bracket teams have 3 byes exactly.
 - most B bracket teams have 3 byes, but some will have 5 byes.
 - the timing and size of the brackets may vary somewhat from year to year depending on the number of game weeks available.

 The following schedule is for a "long year": 25 game weeks. 
(2013/2014 was a short year, i.e. 23 game weeks)

Round One: 21+ teams, 7 weeks (Oct 14 - Nov 25)
------------------------------------------------
A,B bracket placement will be by team points (current system)

A1 bracket: 7 teams, full round robin (six games, one bye)
B1 bracket: 7 teams, full round robin (six games, one bye)
C1 bracket: 7-10 teams, (four games, three byes), 
            11-14 teams (3 games, four byes), 
            15+ teams (?)

[See notes in Addendum for scheduling calculations]

RESULTS:
 - bottom A1 team moves to B2+
 - two bottom B1 teams moves to B2-
 - top six C1 teams survive.
    * top two C1 move to B2- (in for rest of season)
    * next four C1 move to C2

Round Two: 20 teams, 6 weeks (Dec 2 - Jan 6)
----------------------------------------------
A2 bracket: 6 teams, (5 games, one bye)
B2+ bracket: 6 teams, (5 games, one bye)
B2- bracket: 4 teams (3 games, three byes)
C2 bracket: 4 teams (6 games, no byes). 

RESULTS:
 - A2 moves to A3
 - top three B2+ move to A3
 - bottom three B2+ move to B3
 - B2- moves to B3
 - top two C2 teams move to B3, others eliminated.

[See addendum for proposed "short year" schedule.]

Round Three: 18 teams, 9 weeks (Jan 13 - Mar 17)
------------------------------------------------
A3 bracket: 9 teams, full round robin
B3 bracket: 9 teams, full round robin

RESULTS:
 - top 16 by season points move to playoffs.

Round Four: 1 week (Mar 24)
---------------------------
Snow day / Skins Games

Round Five: 2 weeks (Mar 31, Apr 7)
-----------------------------------
Playoffs: same format. (2 week playoffs in brackets of 4)

Note: teams eliminated after round 1 and 2 are eligible for playoffs if they are in the top 16 by points. Unlikely, but possible.


POINTS per game:
----------------
 All A bracket games: 5 win, 1 loss
 All B bracket games: 3 win, 0 loss
 C1 bracket games: 3 win, 0 loss
 C2 bracket games: 1.5 win, 0 loss (balances with B2-)
 

Common Principles to be applied in scheduling every season
----------------------------------------------------------

 - teams seeded into brackets based on total team points
 - minimize byes for higher ranked teams
 - use full round robins and equal numbers of games as much as possible
 - allow for bracket interchange 
 - use game point assignments to reflect relative difficulty of wins/losses in different brackets.
 - keep all games on Tuesdays

ADDENDUM (math, boring details)

Notes on Round One
------------------
[A games (7*6 /2) + B games ( 7*6 /2 ) + C games (7*4/2) = 7*8 = sheets for 7 weeks.]

If necessary (more than 21 teams), C games will be six ends to accommodate 4 games each.

Examples: 
21 teams: 7 in C1. We need 7*4/2 = 14 games. C bracket plays normal 8-end games all session.
24 teams, 10 in C1. We need 10*4/2 = 20 games. 6 weeks 3 games, 1 week 2 games.
28 teams, 14 in C21. We need 14*3/2 = 21 games. 7 weeks 3 games on one sheet/night

Notes on Round Two
------------------

A games (6*5/2)   +
B2+ games (6*5/2) +
B2- games (4*3/2) +
C2 games (4*3) = 48 sheets

Round 2 would be shortened to 4 weeks in a "short year", as follows:
(32 games available)
A2+ 4 teams  full round robin (3 games each, one bye)
A2- 4 teams  full round robin (3 games each, one bye)
B2+ 4 teams  full round robin (3 games each, one bye)
B2- 4 teams  full round robin (3 games each, one bye)
C   4 teams: full round robin (3 games each, one bye)

This leaves two extra game slots available for make up games or possibly C-bracket tiebreakers.

Would have to adjust points in A2+ and A2- (otherwise easier to collect points by being in A2-).
