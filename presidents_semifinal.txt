Dear President's Leaguers:

Thanks for your feedback about last week's proposal on re-structuring 
President's League.

Here is my semi-final proposal for rule changes for next year.


Round One: 24+ teams, 10 weeks (Oct 14 - Dec 16)
------------------------------------------------
A bracket: 8 teams, full round robin
B bracket: 8 teams, full round robin
C bracket: 8+ teams, 6 games. More than 8 teams: we will use 3 draws.

Top 4 teams from C advance to Round Two, others out of Round 2.

(A, B bracket teams will have 3 byes this round.)

A,B bracket placement will be by team points (current system)

Round Two: 20 teams, 5 weeks (Dec 23 - Jan 20)
----------------------------------------------
A bracket: 6 teams, full round robin
B bracket: 6 teams, full round robin
Elimination bracket: bottom four teams from B play top four teams from C in best of 3. Winners play in Round 3, losers out of Round 3.
B1 plays C4 3 times, B2 plays C3 3 times, etc.

A bracket will be top 6 teams by points.
B bracket will be other 6 teams not in Elimination Bracket.

Round Three: 16 teams, 7 weeks (Jan 27 - Mar 17)
------------------------------------------------
A bracket: 8 teams, full round robin
B bracket: 8 teams, full round robin

A bracket will be top 8 teams by points. 
B bracket will be other 8 teams.

Round Four: 1 week (Mar 24)
---------------------------
Snow day / Skins Games

Round Five: 2 weeks (Mar 31, Apr 7)
-----------------------------------
Playoffs: same format. (2 week playoffs in brackets of 4)

Note: teams eliminated after round 1 and 2 are eligible for playoffs if they are in the top 16 by points.


Other rules:
 - all A bracket games will  be 5 points / 1 point as now
 - all B/C/Elimination games will be 3 points/win.

Finally, I have decide to hold off on any changes to the player point rule. While I think the new rule is better long term, it only makes sense to change the rule when the league is already the correct size. 
Otherwise, it may favor "regular/semi-incumbent" players too much.
