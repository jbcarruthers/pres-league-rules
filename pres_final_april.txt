Motivating principles for President's League Rules
--------------------------------------------------

- provide a league size consistent with a high level of play and appropriate to the club's membership size and the number of sheets and draws available for the league.

- encourage a high level of play through a balance of (a) stability (b) experience (c) merit/talent. This balance is achieved by allowing successful teams and players to remain in the league while also providing a fair performance-based mechanism for new teams and/or players to enter the league.


Summary of league format rules:
-------------------------------

- the purpose of President's league is to provide Broomstones members a weekly league with the highest possible level of play. 

- the allocation of points to players at the END OF THE SEASON is unchanged (each team qualifies its four most active players to receive points)

- the team rank at the BEGINNING OF THE SEASON will be determined by the sum of the points of its TOP THREE PLAYERS' points from the immediate prior season.
(i.e. team 1 has highest sum-of-three, team 2 has next highest sum-of-three, and so forth)

 - the league will consist of twenty teams during the regular season. During the playoffs (final weeks of the season), the bottom four teams can be assigned byes throughout the playoffs. 

 - the top 14 teams by rank are in league without challenge

 - teams ranked 15 and below will enter a pre-season challenge round to pick six additional teams. The format will depend on ice availability and number of teams. All teams will be assigned "equivalent" schedules, i.e. there will be no "short paths" based on rank.

 - the season schedule will typically consist of four full rounds (five weeks each), consisting of five-team round-robins, followed by playoffs.

 - the length of the playoffs and the number of "snow/makeup" days will vary from season to season depending on the number of league days available.
