Team Ranking 
------------

At the start of the season, teams are ranked by summing player points.

The "team ranking point total" will be calculated by adding the four
player totals if four players are registered on the team, or the
highest four player totals if five players are registered on the team.

Pre-season Team Entry and Challenge Round
-----------------------------------------

1. Teams ranked 1 to 14 are in the league without challenge. 

2. All other teams are placed into the challenge round to determine
four additional teams. 

3. Round-robin play in pools will determine entry into the league

4. The pool format will be as follows:

* 19 or 20 teams: one pool, top four are in
* 21 to 26 teams. two pools, top two from each pool are in.
* 27 or more teams: four pools, top one from each pool is in.


For each pool, the highest ranked team is the pool captain.  In the
case of un-even pool sizes, additional teams Bye1, Bye2, etc, are
added to make the number of teams evenly divisible by the number of
pools. The pool captains take turns picking teams to join their pool
in round-robin fashion until all teams are formed into a pool.

The final pool rankings will be determined as follows:

* record (most wins)
* head-to-head (this rule is only applied once. For example , if three
  teams are tied in record, and their head-to-heads are 1-1, 1-1, and
  0-2, the two teams tied are 1-1 "continue" and are evaluated by the
  next item, not by head-to-head again)
* ends won
* points scored
* team shootout


Examples: 21 teams: 7 challenge teams two pools of 3 and 4

Teams C1 and C2 pick from C3-C7 and Bye

One typical sequence:

Pool One C1: bye,c6,c4. Top 2 qualify
Pool Two C2: c7,c5,c3: Top 2 qualify

Another sequence:

Pool One C1: c7, c6,  c4. Top 2 qualify
Pool Two C2: bye, c5, c3. Top 2 qualify

Finally: 
Pool One C1: C7,C5,C3
Pool Two C2: C6,C4,bye

Mid-season Challenge Rounds
---------------------------

Option 1. 

Mid-season challenge rounds are eliminated. The eighteen teams that
qualify at the beginning of the season remain through the last round
robin and playoffs.

Option 2.

Keep the existing system: all challengers play down, play against 18.

Option 3.

Round robin of team 18 and 3 challengers. If there are more than 3 challengers, then best record in the first challenge round seeds the challengers.


Assigning Points to Fifths
--------------------------

* all players (fifths, alternates, regulars) who played in 3 or more
  games are eligible for points

* each team must designate up to four players as "regulars" and all other players to receive points as "alternates".

* suppose the team's point value is T. Then the points assigned to each alternate will be

A_i = T*(games player by alternate i / games played by team)

* Each regular will be assigned the same points, as follows:

NR = number of regulars

R_j = (4T-sum(A_i)) / NR


Note that the total points assigned will be 4T, since

Example: Suppose the team points are 20, and six players played.
The alternates played in 4 and 9 games out of 25 total.

Then the player points are

A_1 = 4/25*20 = 3.2

A_2 = 9/25*20 = 7.2

R_1 = R_2 = R_3 = R_4 = 17.4
