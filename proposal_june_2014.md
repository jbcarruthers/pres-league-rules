## Section 0. Executive Summary

- 20 team league, 14 guaranteed, others challenge for 6 spots.
- team entry based on top three players points
- league will be 2 or 3 full rounds followed by playoffs

## Section 1. Background

A. Why President's should change

President's League has been Broomstones most competitive league for decades. Its rules and format have changed over the years along with the club. Its "problems" are a largely result of growth of the club membership.

The current league size is 18 teams, but substantially more teams would like to play in the league (25 teams participated in 2013-2014). Currently, 16 teams are guaranteed entry, 17/18 share one spot, and the loser and all other teams compete for one additional spot.

The ranking system which determined who gets into the league is flawed (overly favors current players) and the challenge  round system is flawed (overly favors current teams, difficult to schedulwe)

The league size limit places enormous importance on the player-point 
assignment algorithm, and can lead to team selection based on point status rather than merit. Entry into the league is based on previous performance 
in the league, which is a barrier to entry for new teams.

Finally, there is a scheduling issue: the season is not long enough to run 3 full round robins (even when Christmas/New Years falls away from Tuesday). This leads to inequities in scheduling the final partial "round robin". 


B. About the process

Earlier versions of this document were circulated to President's League members for comment throughout the spring of 2014, and an open forum to discuss the changes was announced and held on April 15th, 2014. 

This document represents the results of those discussions and meetings, with details filled in by the league coordinator.

## Section 2. Motivating principles for President's League Rules

- provide a league size consistent with a high level of play and appropriate to the club's membership size and the number of sheets and draws available for the league.

- encourage a high level of play through a balance of (a) stability (b) experience (c) merit/talent. This balance is achieved by allowing successful teams and players to remain in the league while also providing a fair performance-based mechanism for new teams and/or players to enter the league.


## Section 3. Changes we need from the club

1. A pre-arranged pre-season Saturday or Sunday of ice time (all day)
2. Early registration deadline (9 days prior to the challenge round day)
3. Authority to limit registration to 30 teams, as follows: 
   - all N teams with points (or the 30 teams with the most points)
   - the FIRST 30-N teams with no points.

## Section 4. Summary of new league rules

A. League Purpose

The purpose of President's league is to provide Broomstones members a weekly league with the highest possible level of play. 

B. League Size

The allocation of points to players at the END OF THE SEASON is unchanged (each team qualifies its four most active players to receive points)

The league will consist of twenty teams during the regular season. During the final weeks of the season the bottom four teams can be assigned byes.

C. League Entry

The top 14 teams by rank are in league without challenge.

Teams ranked 15 and below will enter a pre-season challenge round to pick six additional teams. The format will depend on ice availability and number of teams. All teams will be assigned "equivalent" schedules, i.e. there will be no "short paths" based on rank. See Section 5: Challenge Round for details.

There will be no mid-season challenges. 

The team rank at the BEGINNING OF THE SEASON will be determined by the sum of the points of each entering team's TOP THREE PLAYERS' points from the immediate prior season. (i.e. team 1 has highest sum-of-three, team 2 has next highest sum-of-three, and so forth)

D. Season Schedule

The season schedule will typically consist of full round robin rounds followed by playoffs. The details of the season schedule format options and plans are contained in Section 6: League Scheduling 

## Section 5. Challenge Round

If 20 or fewer teams sign up, no challenge round will be held and all teams are in the league.

The challenge round format will depend on the total number of entered teams, as follows:
 
- 21 or 22 teams: two pools, round robin, 3 draws
- 23 to 26 teams: double elimination, 4 draws
- 27 to 30 teams: double elimination, 6 draws

If more than 30 teams sign up:

  - all N teams with points (or the 30 teams with the most points) are in the league or challenge round.

  - the "FIRST TO REGISTER" 30-N teams with no points are in the league or challenge round.


Details of the brackets follow.


The challenge rounds will follow a peer seeding process, as follows:

All N teams in challenge round rank all other teams 1 (highest) to N-1 (lowest)

Each team will have N-1 ranks. The outlier ranks will be eliminated: the top rank and the bottom rank will be removed.

     SeedRank=mean(middle N-3 seeds) 

The teams will then be ranked in descending order of the SeedRank.

### Challenge for 21/22 teams (two teams out)

8 teams form two pools of 4 by peer seeding, as follows:

    Pool 1: C1 C4 C5 C8
    Pool 2: C2 C3 C6 C7

Bottom team from each pool is out.

Teams 15 and 16 cannot be in the same pool.

Team 16 will swap with team in opposite pool closest 
to its rank. Example: if 15 is ranked C2 and 16
is ranked 3, then 16 swaps with C4

REQUIRES: 3 full draws, 3 games each

### Challenge for 23/24/25/26 teams

22. W18-W19 (6v7) winner in

Requires 6 draws (maximum four games for any one team)



## Section 6. League Schedule

The league schedule will be determined by fitting a combination of "scheduling blocks" into the available number of weeks for the league season, with provisions for cancelled weeks (due to snow or other emergencies).


### Blocks

For a twenty team league with two draws on four sheets, the two viable options 
are a 5 week block with each team playing 4 games, or a 10 week block with each 
team playing 8 games. The third option is an 11 week block, but the scheduling is tricky.

Shorter blocks (2 or 3 weeks) can only be done by restricting the number of teams and these will be reserved for playoffs.


#### THE FIVE WEEK BLOCK

In a five week block, we would form four pools of five teams.

Each pool would play a full round robin, and each team would get a bye.

The league could either be organized as two "A" pools and two "B" pools, or four divisions "A", "B", "C", and "D".

#### THE TEN WEEK BLOCK

In a ten week block, each team plays eight games.

The league could be split into an "A" division with ten teams and a "B" division with ten teams. 

Each team would play eight out of the possible nine opponents in their division.

The games "not played" could be chosen from a variety of schemes, including

1v2,3v4,5v6,7v8,9v10
OR
1v6,2v7,3v8,4v9,5v10
OR
1v10,2v9,3v8,4v7,5v6

### THE ELEVEN WEEK BLOCK

Two pools of ten teams are formed and each plays a full round robin.

However, this involves 90 games and only 88 are available. The two extra games 
can be made up by scheduling off-Tuesday or by scheduling 6 games for 2 sheets 
on one night.

### PLAYOFFS

With a larger league and a new schedule, the format for the playoffs
can be adjusted. The basic format will remain: seedings into brackets
of four will be done based on the regular season standings.  This
provides a reasonable balance between allowing teams to "move up"
during the playoffs and rewarding teams with a good regular season by
guaranteeing a "minimum final position"

#### Two Week Playoffs

In a two week playoff, the current system would be maintained: the top sixteen would form four brackets of four teams. 

The final rankings for teams 17-20 would be based on season points.


### Three Week Playoffs

With three weeks available, all twenty teams can have a playoff and the 
format for Presidents and Moore can be switched to a Page system.

A Page playoff can be done over three weeks with two games in the first week, one game in the second week, and the championship in the second week. 

The Presidents and Moore brackets would use Page playoffs. 
The Tequila Bowl and Cheap Wine divisions would complete a full round robin, and Moonshine division would play two games (current system)


### Snow Days


If snow day(s) are necessary:

- the three week playoffs can  be shortened to a 2 week playoff

- a 5 block can be converted into a 4 block by playing ten games each night.


### Proposed Schedules based on Season Length

In the following scenarios, all twenty teams are in the league for the entire season:

25 weeks: 11 block, 11 block, 3 week playoff 

24 weeks: 11 block, 5 block, 5 block, 3 week playoff

23 weeks: 10 block, 5 block, 5 block, 3 week playoff

22 weeks: 10 block, 5 block, 5 block, 2 week playoff


For the 10/11 blocks, an A bracket and B bracket are formed.



For the 5 blocks, teams are split into two A brackets and two B brackets, as follows:

Red: A1, A4, A5, A8, A9
Yellow: A2, A3, A6, A7, A10

Red: B1, B4, B5, B8, B9
Yellow: B2, B3, B6, B7, B10

After each round, two teams from B swap with two teams from A.

The ten teams in each bracket are ranked, as follows:
1. Season Points
2. Head-to-head for season (highest winning percentage among tied teams)
3. Last Round Points
4. Head-to-head for last round
5. Ranking at the beginning of the previous round.

Game points are awarded as is currently done:

- A bracket: 5 win, 1 loss

- B bracket: 3 win

#### PLAYOFFS

After the final round, all twenty teams are ranked as follows:
1. Season points
2. Head-to-head for season (highest winning percentage among tied teams)
3. Ranking at the beginning of previous round




#### Alternative Schedule with Pruning

In the proposed schedule, each team would have four bye weeks. These could be 
eliminated by playing more draws / six end games, but in the absence of 
consensus on that solution.

An alternative is to "prune" the league back to sixteen or eighteen teams at the end of the season.

25 weeks: 11 block, 5 block (PRUNE), 7 block (16teams,RR, no byes), 2 week playoff

24 weeks: 11 block, 5 block (PRUNE), 3 block (4x4 RR), 3 block, 2 week playoff

23 weeks: 11 block, 5 block (PRUNE), 7 week playoff round robin

22 weeks: 10 block, 5 block (PRUNE), 7 week playoff round robin


## Addendum A. Scheduling Block Math

If all teams are to play equal numbers of games, we need Weeks (schedule length) and Games (number of games each team plays) to satisfy

     Sheets * Draws * Weeks  = Teams * Games / 2

At Broomstones, Sheets=2 and Draws=2

For Presidents, we proposed Teams=20 

Plugging in the numbers gives: 
    
     8 * Weeks = 10 * Games

The solutions are:
 -  5 weeks,  4 games
 - 10 weeks,  8 games
 - 15 weeks, 12 games
 - 20 weeks, 16 games

The first two options are viable, the other two don't really work. All other schedules suffer from one or more of the following problems:

- unequal number of games 
- additional games (requires shorter games and/or more draws)



## Addendum B. Alternate Schedules and Discussion

### 6a. Ladder Based League Format


There are no points for winning games. 
Rankings will be determined by bracket placement and results, as described below.

Each round has four 5-team brackets, labelled A, B, C, D.

[Initial placement into brackets: A1-A5, B1-B5, C1-C4 by ranking. 
Winner of Challenge becomes C5, 5 other teams from challenge go into D.]

After round one,
 bottom two from A swap with top two from B.
 bottom two from B swap with top two from C.
 bottom two from C swap with top two from D. (note: bottom 2 from C are OUT of championship)

At end of round two:
 bottom one from A swaps with top one from B.
 bottom one from B swaps with top one from C. (note: bottom B is OUT of championship)
 bottom one from C swaps with top one from D.

After round three:
 bottom one from A swaps with top one from B. (note: bottom A is OUT of championship)
 bottom one from B swaps with top one from C.
 bottom one from C swaps with top one from D.
 
 #### PLAYOFFS

 After round four:
  A1-A4 are in Presidents.
  A5 and B1-B3 are in Moore.
  B4,B5,C1,C2 are in Tequila
  C3,C4,C5,D1 are in Cheap Wine.
  D2-D5 are out.

During round 1: all teams can win league
During round 2: only A,B, and C teams can win the league
During round 3: only A and B teams can win the league
During round 4: only current A teams can win the league

#### END OF ROUND RANKINGS / TIE BREAKERS

Tie breakers are critical in this league format since team-movement is everything.

At the end of each round, teams from each bracket will be ranked one to five, as follows.

1. Best round record (e.g. 4-0, 3-1 , 2-2 , 1-3 , 0-4)
2. Head-to-head record in the round (this is definitive in all cases with two-way ties)
3. Most A bracket wins for season. 
4. Most B bracket wins for season. 
5. Most C bracket wins for season. 
6. Most D bracket wins for season.
7. Fewest forfeited games
8. Lowest shootout score
9. Coin-flip/draw straws.

#### SUMMARY OF PROS-CONS

- PRO: games become progressively more meaningful as the season progresses. Early season losses are irrelevant in determining placement for most teams.

- CON: since not every game matters, more forfeits and less focus is possible

- PRO: there is no artificial re-shuffling based on "A points" and "B points".

### 6b. Balanced League Format


There are no points for winning games. 
Rankings will be determined by bracket placement and results, as described below.

During each round, the league will be split into two balanced ten-team brackets.


Red division:    1 4 5 8  9 12 13 16 17 20

Yellow division: 2 3 6 7 10 11 14 15 18 19

Each round will require 90 games to be played in 11 weeks. This means that once a round, six games will be played on two sheets instead of four. The games can be six ends to make the timing reasonable.


After round one,
 - Teams are ranked 1-10 in each division. 
 - Teams in the EVEN spots swap leagues:
  - yellow 2 swaps with red 2 
  - yellow 4 swaps with red 4
  - yellow 6 swaps with red 6
  - yellow 8 swaps with red 8
  - yellow 10 swaps with red 10

At end of round two, we will be in the playoffs.

#### PLAYOFFS

- Top four teams are in Presidents
- Next four are in Moore
- Next four are in Tequila
- Next four are in Cheap Wine
- Next four are in Moonshine

#### END OF ROUND RANKINGS / TIE BREAKERS


1. Best overall record
2. Best round record
3. Head-to-head record overall 
4. Head-to-head record in the round
5. Fewest forfeited games
6. Lowest shootout score
7. Coin-flip/draw straws.

#### SUMMARY OF PROS-CONS

- PRO: everyone has a fair shot at winning the league

- PRO: there is no artificial re-shuffling based on "A points" and "B points".

- CON: there may be more "blowouts" since top "A" teams will play "B" teams often.
