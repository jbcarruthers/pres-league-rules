## 1. Background

The following proposed changes to the format for President's League 
are intended to address the following issues:

-- the league is limited to 18 teams, and employs a challenge 
round system to fill the last two spots. Many more teams would like 
to participate if there was room in the league (about 25 teams 
played or challenged this year)

-- the ranking system has flaws (see below) and the challenge 
round system has flaws (scheduling, finding ice time, etc)

-- the league size limit places enormous importance on the player-point 
assignment algorithm, and can lead to team selection based on point status rather than merit.

-- league entry into the league is based on previous performance 
in the league, which is a barrier to entry for new teams.

-- player points are assigned based solely on last year's performance, 
unfairly penalizing absences from the league.

-- the season is not long enough to run 3 full round robins
 (even when Christmas/New Years falls away from Tuesday). This leads to inequities in scheduling the final partial "round robin"

## 2. Motivating principles for President's League Rules

- provide a league size consistent with a high level of play and appropriate to the club's membership size and the number of sheets and draws available for the league.

- encourage a high level of play through a balance of (a) stability (b) experience (c) merit/talent. This balance is achieved by allowing successful teams and players to remain in the league while also providing a fair performance-based mechanism for new teams and/or players to enter the league.


## 3. Changes we need from the club

1. A pre-arranged pre-season Saturday or Sunday of ice time (all day)
2. Early registration deadline (9 days prior to the challenge round day)
3. Authority to limit registration to 30 teams, as follows: 
   - all N teams with points (or the 30 teams with the most points)
   - the FIRST 30-N teams with no points. 


## 4. Summary of league format rules

- the purpose of President's league is to provide Broomstones members a weekly league with the highest possible level of play. 

- the allocation of points to players at the END OF THE SEASON is unchanged (each team qualifies its four most active players to receive points)

- the team rank at the BEGINNING OF THE SEASON will be determined by the sum of the points of each entering team's TOP THREE PLAYERS' points from the immediate prior season.
(i.e. team 1 has highest sum-of-three, team 2 has next highest sum-of-three, and so forth)

 - the league will consist of twenty teams during the regular season. During the playoffs (final weeks of the season), the bottom four teams can be assigned byes throughout the playoffs. 

 - the top 14 teams by rank are in league without challenge

 - teams ranked 15 and below will enter a pre-season challenge round to pick six additional teams. The format will depend on ice availability and number of teams. All teams will be assigned "equivalent" schedules, i.e. there will be no "short paths" based on rank.

 - the season schedule will typically consist of full round robin rounds followed by playoffs.
The format of the brackets will be determined by a Presidents League Scheduling Committee based on the number of league days available. Three formats are currently under consideration
 
  1. A/B bracket (similar to current: points determine playoff seeding)
  2. Ladder system ( no points: brackets determine playoff seeding)
  3. Balanced brackets (win/loss record determines playoff seeding)




## 5. Challenge Round Format Details


### 22 teams (two teams out)

8 teams form two pools of 4 by peer seeding, as follows:

Pool 1: C1 C4 C5 C8
Pool 2: C2 C3 C6 C7

Bottom team from each pool is out.

Teams 15 and 16 cannot be in the same pool.

Team 16 will swap with team in opposite pool closest 
to its rank. Example: if 15 is ranked C2 and 16
is ranked 3, then 16 swaps with C4

 Seeding=mean(middle N-3 seeds) 

## 6. Possible Schedules

### 6a. Points-based League Format

Top 10 teams are placed in A.
Next 4 are in B with the 6 winners of challenge round.

#### Round One

Teams are split into two A brackets and two B brackets, as follows:

A1, A4, A5, A8, A9
A2, A3, A6, A7, A10

B1, B4, B5, B8, B9
B2, B3, B6, B7, B10

#### Round Two

After round one,
 Top team from each B pool moves to A
 Bottom team from each A pool moves to B.

Ten teams in each bracket are ranked, as follows:
1. Season Points
2. Head-to-head for season
3. Last Round Points
4. Head-to-head for last round
5. Ranking at the beginning of the previous round.

#### Round Three

After round two,
 Top team from each B pool moves to A
 Bottom team from each A pool moves to B.

Ten teams in each bracket are ranked, as follows:
1. Season Points

B bracket: 3 win

#### PLAYOFFS

After round four, all twenty teams are ranked as follows:
1. Season points
2. Head-to-head for season
3. Ranking at the beginning of previous round

### 6b. Ladder Based League Format


There are no points for winning games. 
Rankings will be determined by bracket placement and results, as described below.

Each round has four 5-team brackets, labelled A, B, C, D.

[Initial placement into brackets: A1-A5, B1-B5, C1-C4 by ranking. 
Winner of Challenge becomes C5, 5 other teams from challenge go into D.]

After round one,
 bottom two from A swap with top two from B.
 bottom two from B swap with top two from C.
 bottom two from C swap with top two from D. (note: bottom 2 from C are OUT of championship)

At end of round two:
 bottom one from A swaps with top one from B.
 bottom one from B swaps with top one from C. (note: bottom B is OUT of championship)
 bottom one from C swaps with top one from D.

After round three:
 bottom one from A swaps with top one from B. (note: bottom A is OUT of championship)
 bottom one from B swaps with top one from C.
 bottom one from C swaps with top one from D.
 
 #### PLAYOFFS

 After round four:
  A1-A4 are in Presidents.
  A5 and B1-B3 are in Moore.
  B4,B5,C1,C2 are in Tequila
  C3,C4,C5,D1 are in Cheap Wine.
  D2-D5 are out.

During round 1: all teams can win league
During round 2: only A,B, and C teams can win the league
During round 3: only A and B teams can win the league
During round 4: only current A teams can win the league

#### END OF ROUND RANKINGS / TIE BREAKERS

Tie breakers are critical in this league format since team-movement is everything.

At the end of each round, teams from each bracket will be ranked one to five, as follows.

1. Best round record (e.g. 4-0, 3-1 , 2-2 , 1-3 , 0-4)
2. Head-to-head record in the round (this is definitive in all cases with two-way ties)
3. Most A bracket wins for season. 
4. Most B bracket wins for season. 
5. Most C bracket wins for season. 
6. Most D bracket wins for season.
7. Fewest forfeited games
8. Lowest shootout score
9. Coin-flip/draw straws.

#### SUMMARY OF PROS-CONS

- PRO: games become progressively more meaningful as the season progresses. Early season losses are irrelevant in determining placement for most teams.

- CON: since not every game matters, more forfeits and less focus is possible

- PRO: there is no artificial re-shuffling based on "A points" and "B points".

### 6c. Balanced League Format


There are no points for winning games. 
Rankings will be determined by bracket placement and results, as described below.

During each round, the league will be split into two balanced ten-team brackets.


Red division:    1 4 5 8  9 12 13 16 17 20
Yellow division: 2 3 6 7 10 11 14 15 18 19

Each round will require 90 games to be played in 11 weeks. This means that once a round, six games will be played on two sheets instead of four. The games can be six-ends to make the timing reasonable.


After round one,
 Teams are ranked 1-10 in each division. 

 Teams in the EVEN spots swap leagues:
 
 yellow 2 swaps with red 2 
 yellow 4 swaps with red 4
 yellow 6 swaps with red 6
 yellow 8 swaps with red 8  
 yellow 10 swaps with red 10

At end of round two, we will be in the playoffs.

#### PLAYOFFS

Top four teams are in Presidents.
Next four are in Moore.
Next four are in Tequila
Next four are in Cheap Wine
Next four are in Bad Moonshine

#### END OF ROUND RANKINGS / TIE BREAKERS


1. Best overall record.
2. Best round record.
3. Head-to-head record overall 
4. Head-to-head record in the round
5. Fewest forfeited games
6. Lowest shootout score
7. Coin-flip/draw straws.

SUMMARY OF PROS-CONS
--------------------
- PRO: everyone has a fair shot at winning the league

- PRO: there is no artificial re-shuffling based on "A points" and "B points".

- CON: there may be more "blowouts" since top "A" teams will play "B" teams often.
