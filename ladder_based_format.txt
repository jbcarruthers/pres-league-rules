END OF ROUND RANKINGS / TIE BREAKERS
------------

Tie breakers are critical in this league format since team-movement is everything.

At the end of each round, teams from each bracket will be ranked one to five, as follows.

1. Best round record (e.g. 4-0, 3-1 , 2-2 , 1-3 , 0-4)
2. Head-to-head record in the round (this is definitive in all cases with two-way ties)
3. Most A bracket wins for season. 
4. Most B bracket wins for season. 
5. Most C bracket wins for season. 
6. Most D bracket wins for season.
7. Fewest forfeited games
8. Lowest shootout score
9. Coin-flip/draw straws.

SUMMARY OF PROS-CONS
--------------------
- PRO: games become progressively more meaningful as the season progresses. Early season losses are irrelevant in determining placement for most teams.

- CON: since not every game matters, more forfeits and less focus is possible

- PRO: there is no artificial re-shuffling based on "A points" and "B points".
