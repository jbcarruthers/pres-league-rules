TEAM RANKINGS AND PLAYER POINTS

1. Team Ranking
---------------

At the start of the season, teams are ranked by summing player points.

The "team ranking point total" will be calculated by adding the four
player totals if four players are registered on the team, or the
highest four player totals if five players are registered on the team.

2. Player Points
----------------

Each player will be assigned the larger of the following points:
 
  - the team points assigned to the player based on the prior year team placement. Note: the last placed team players are assigned 10 points.

  - three points for each President's League season played in the past 7 years, up to a maximum of 15 points.


3. Assigning Points to Fifths 
-----------------------------

* all players (fifths, alternates, regulars) who played in 3 or more
games are eligible for points

* each team must designate up to four players as "regulars" and all
other players to receive points as "alternates".

* suppose the team's point value is T. Then the points assigned to
each alternate will be

A_i = T*(games player by alternate i / games played by team)

* Each regular will be assigned the same points, as follows:

NR = number of regulars

R_j = (4T-sum(A_i)) / NR

Note that the total points assigned will be 4T, since

Example: Suppose the team points are 20, and six players played. The
alternates played in 4 and 9 games out of 25 total.

Then the player points are

A_1 = 4/25*20 = 3.2
A_2 = 9/25*20 = 7.2
R_1 = R_2 = R_3 = R_4 = 17.4

BRACKETS AND LEAGUE FORMAT
--------------------------

4. Brackets and Team Entry 
--------------------------

Teams ranked 1 to 7 are seeded into the first round of A bracket.
Teams ranked 8 to 14 are seeded into the first round of B bracket. All
other teams are placed in the C bracket.


5. A and B bracket format
-------------------------

A full round robin of 7 teams requires 21 games: 3 games each week
over 7 weeks. Each team will have one bye during each round.

The A and B bracket will each play three full round robins, and will
then enter a 2-game 16-team playoff (same format as currently). This
requires 23 games: any extra games will be played after the third
round robin and before the playoffs.

Points for A bracket games will still be 5/1, and B bracket games 3/0.

6. C bracket format
-------------------

1. The pre-season challenge round is eliminated, and all entered teams
ranked 15 or below will be entered into the C bracket.

2. If 21 or fewer teams enter the league, then the C bracket  will
start with a full round-robin among its 7 or fewer teams. A seven-team round robin requires 21 games: 14 of these C bracket games would be played on Tuesday, and we would request one sheet of one draw on another night to accomodate the C bracket.

3. If 22 or more teams enter the league, then C bracket will consist
of all teams ranked 15th and below.

4. (concept one) first round is open, 2nd and 3rd C bracket rounds
are 7 teams only. Two balanced pools are formed based on peer seeding.

    a. Even number of teams: The top three from each pool qualify, and
    the 4th placed teams play an elimination draw.

    b. Odd number of teams: the larger pool qualifies four teams, the
    smaller pool qualifies three teams

    c. After the first qualifying round, the C bracket will play two full round robins with 7 teams. There will be no challengers after round 2 or 3. 

4. (concept two) all rounds are open (no limit on number of teams).
Each team is allocated the same number of games each round, but a full
round robin may not be possible depending on ice availability.

Example: suppose there are 12 C-bracket teams (26 teams in total).
Each team would have 3 games per round, for a total of 18 games. 14 of
these would be played on Tuesdays.

After the completion of a round, new teams may enter into the C bracket. 

5. C bracket game-points would be 3 during rounds in which a seven
team round robin is not played. During a regular 7-team round robin, C bracket game points would be 2 for a win, 0 for a loss.


7. Bracket Interchange
----------------------

At the end of each round, the bottom two A bracket teams swap places with the top two B bracket teams. 

The bottom two B bracket teams swap places with the top two C bracket teams. If the C bracket round was a "single pool", then the top two teams enter into B. If the C bracket round was a "double pool", then the top team from each pool enters into B.
