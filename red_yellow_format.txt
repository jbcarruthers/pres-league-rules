RED/YELLOW BASED LEAGUE FORMAT
--------------------------

There are no points for winning games. 
Rankings will be determined by bracket placement and results, as described below.

During each round, the league will be split into two balanced ten-team brackets.


Red division:    1 4 5 8  9 12 13 16 17 20
Yellow division: 2 3 6 7 10 11 14 15 18 19

Each round will require 90 games to be played in 11 weeks. This means that once a round, six games will be played on two sheets instead of four. The games can be six-ends to make the timing reasonable.



After round one,
 Teams are ranked 1-10 in each division. 

 Teams in the EVEN spots swap leagues:
 
 yellow 2 swaps with red 2 
 yellow 4 swaps with red 4
 yellow 6 swaps with red 6
 yellow 8 swaps with red 8  
 yellow 10 swaps with red 10

At end of round two, we will be in the playoffs.

SUMMARY OF PROS-CONS
--------------------
